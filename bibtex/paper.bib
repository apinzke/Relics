	Abstract = {Recent improvements in the capabilities of low-frequency radio telescopes provide a unique opportunity to study thermal and non-thermal properties of the cosmic web. We argue that the diffuse, polarized emission from giant radio relics traces structure formation shock waves and illuminates the large-scale magnetic field. To show this, we model the population of shock-accelerated relativistic electrons in high-resolution cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters and calculate the resulting radio synchrotron emission. We find that individual shock waves correspond to localized peaks in the radio surface brightness map which enables us to measure Mach numbers for these shocks. We show that the luminosities and number counts of the relics strongly depend on the magnetic field properties, the cluster mass and dynamical state. By suitably combining different cluster data, including Faraday rotation measures, we are able to constrain some macroscopic parameters of the plasma at the structure formation shocks, such as models of turbulence. We also predict upper limits for the properties of the warm-hot intergalactic medium, such as its temperature and density. We predict that the current generation of radio telescopes [Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), Giant Meter Radio Telescope (GMRT), the Murchison Wide-field Array (MWA) and Long Wavelength Array (LWA)] have the potential to discover a substantially larger sample of radio relics, with multiple relics expected for each violently merging cluster. Future experiments [(Square Kilometre Array (SKA)] should enable us to further probe the macroscopic parameters of plasma physics in clusters. },

	Abstract = {The acceleration to relativistic energies of the high-energy tail of the particle distribution produced by a shock front is discussed. In order to be accelerated, particles need be able to pass through the shock without being strongly deflected. It is argued, using earth's bow shock as an example, that a shock front produces large numbers of protons, and probably electrons also, which satisfy this condition. The resulting energy spectrum of these initially nonrelativistic particles is calculated. It yields an estimate of the density of cosmic-ray particles in a shocked gas and indicates that a large proportion of the random energy produced by a shock is given to accelerated particles. The synchrotron radio emission from the energetic electrons in a shocked gas is calculated, and the theoretical and observed flux densities of two supernova remnants (Tycho's SNR and Cas A) are compared and found to agree satisfactorily. The implications for the minimum energy of radio sources are considered, and the effect of multiple shocks on the cosmic-ray density evaluated. },

	Abstract = {The central idea of diffusive shock acceleration is presented from microscopic and macroscopic viewpoints; applied to reactionless test particles in a steady plane shock the mechanism is shown to produce a power law spectrum in momentum with a slope which, to lowest order in the ratio of plasma to particle speed, depends only on the compression in the shock. The associated time scale is found (also by a macroscopic and a microscopic method) and the problems of spherical shocks, as exemplified by a point explosion and a stellar-wind terminator, are treated by singular perturbation theory. The effect of including the particle reaction is then studied. It is shown that if the scattering is due to resonant waves these can rapidly grow with unknown consequences. The possible steady modified shock structures are classified and generalised Rankine-Hugoniot conditions found. Modifications of the spectrum are discussed on the basis of an exact, if rather artificial, solution, a high-energy asymptotic expansion and a perturbation expansion due to Blandford. It is pointed out that no steady solution can exist for very strong shocks; the possible time dependence is briefly discussed. },

	Abstract = {We give for a plasma with a history of several expansion and contraction phases an analytical model of the evolution of a contained relativistic electron population under synchrotron, inverse Compton and adiabatic energy losses or gains. This is applied to different scenarios for evolution of radio plasma inside the cocoons of radio galaxies, after the activity of the central engine has ceased. It is demonstrated that fossil radio plasma with an age of even up to 2 Gyr can be revived by compression in a shock wave of large-scale structure formation, caused during the merging events of galaxy clusters, or by the accretion onto galaxy clusters. We argue, that this is a highly plausible explanation for the observed cluster radio relics, which are the regions of diffuse radio emission found in clusters of galaxies, without any likely parent radio galaxy seen nearby. An implication of this model is the existence of a population of diffuse, ultra-steep spectrum, very low frequency radio sources located inside and possibly outside of clusters of galaxies, tracing the revival of aged fossil radio plasma by the shock waves associated with large-scale structure formation. },

	Abstract = {We investigate the interplay of cosmic ray (CR) propagation and advection in galaxy clusters. Propagation in form of CR diffusion and streaming tends to drive the CR radial profiles towards being flat, with equal CR number density everywhere. Advection of CR by the turbulent gas motions tends to produce centrally enhanced profiles. We assume that the CR streaming velocity is of the order of the sound velocity. This is motivated by plasma physical arguments. The CR streaming is then usually larger than typical advection velocities and becomes comparable or lower than this only for periods with trans- and super-sonic cluster turbulence. As a consequence a bimodality of the CR spatial distribution results. Strongly turbulent, merging clusters should have a more centrally concentrated CR energy density profile with respect to relaxed ones with very subsonic turbulence. This translates into a bimodality of the expected diffuse radio and gamma-ray emission of clusters, since more centrally concentrated CR will find higher target densities for hadronic CR proton interactions, higher plasma wave energy densities for CR electron and proton re-acceleration, and stronger magnetic fields. Thus, the observed bimodality of cluster radio halos appears to be a natural consequence of the interplay of CR transport processes, independent of the model of radio halo formation, be it hadronic interactions of CR protons or re-acceleration of low-energy CR electrons. Energy dependence of the CR propagation should lead to spectral steepening of dying radio halos. Furthermore, we show that the interplay of CR diffusion with advection implies first order CR re-acceleration in the pressure-stratified atmospheres of galaxy clusters. Finally, we argue that CR streaming could be important in turbulent cool cores of galaxy clusters since it heats preferentially the central gas with highest cooling rate. },

	Abstract = {We estimate the energy release of black hole formation to the intra-cluster medium of the Coma cluster and find that this is comparable to the present day energy content. Therefore an energetic and maybe hydrostatic influence is possible. Our calculations rely on the assumption of an universal black hole to galaxy mass ratio (more exactly: spheroidal mass component of the stellar population), for which there is growing evidence. On a cosmological scale, there is also an energy release of black hole formation comparable to what is expected to be present within the thermal gas, caused by the process of structure formation. This indicates an important dynamical influence, neglected by present day structure formation simulations. This estimate of cosmological black hole energy release is independent of the black hole to galaxy mass ratio, but consistent with its value. },

	Abstract = {We review observations of extended regions of radio emission in clusters; these include diffuse emission in `relics', and the large central regions commonly referred to as `halos'. The spectral observations, as well as Faraday rotation measurements of background and cluster radio sources, provide the main evidence for large-scale intracluster magnetic fields and significant densities of relativistic electrons. Implications from these observations on acceleration mechanisms of these electrons are reviewed, including turbulent and shock acceleration, and also the origin of some of the electrons in collisions of relativistic protons by ambient protons in the (thermal) gas. Improved knowledge of non-thermal phenomena in clusters requires more extensive and detailed radio measurements; we briefly review prospects for future observations. },

@article{gargate12,
	Abstract = {We explore the physics of shock evolution and particle acceleration in non-relativistic collisionless shocks using hybrid simulations. We analyze a wide range of physical parameters relevant to the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs) in astrophysical shock scenarios. We show that there are fundamental differences between high and low Mach number shocks in terms of the electromagnetic turbulence generated in the pre-shock zone; dominant modes are resonant with the streaming CRs in the low Mach number regime, while both resonant and non-resonant modes are present for high Mach numbers. Energetic power-law tails for ions in the downstream plasma account for up to 15% of the incoming upstream flow energy, distributed over ~5% of the particles in a power law with slope -2 $\pm$ 0.2 in energy. Quasi-parallel shocks with theta <= 45$\,^{\circ}$ are good ion accelerators, while power laws are greatly suppressed for quasi-perpendicular shocks, theta > 45$\,^{\circ}$. The efficiency of conversion of flow energy into the energy of accelerated particles peaks at theta = 15$\,^{\circ}$-30$\,^{\circ}$ and MA = 6, and decreases for higher Mach numbers, down to ~2% for MA = 31. Accelerated particles are produced by diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and by shock drift acceleration (SDA) mechanisms, with the SDA contribution to the overall energy gain increasing with magnetic inclination. We also present a direct comparison between hybrid and fully kinetic particle-in-cell results at early times. In supernova remnant (SNR) shocks, particle acceleration will be significant for low Mach number quasi-parallel flows (MA < 30, theta < 45). This finding underscores the need for an effective magnetic amplification mechanism in SNR shocks.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We present new high sensitivity observations of the radio relic in A 521 carried out using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at 327 MHz and with the Very Large Array at 4.9 and 8.5 GHz.  Methods: We imaged the relic at these frequencies and carried out a detailed spectral analysis, based on the integrated radio spectrum between 235 MHz and 4.9 GHz, and on the spectral index image in the frequency range 327-610 MHz. In our present analysis we use our new GMRT observations in addition to proprietary and archival data. We search for a possible shock front co-located with the relic on a short archival Chandra X-ray observation of the cluster.  Results: The integrated spectrum of the relic is consistent with a single power law; the spectral index image shows a clear trend of steepening going from the outer portion of the relic toward the cluster centre. We discuss the origin of the source in the light of theoretical models for the formation of cluster radio relics. Our results on the spectral properties of the relic are consistent with acceleration of relativistic electrons by a shock in the intracluster medium. This scenario is supported by our detection of an X-ray surface brightness edge coincident with the outer border of the radio relic. This edge is probably a shock front.},

@article{hoeft08,
	Abstract = {Large-scale diffuse radio emission is observed in some clusters of galaxies. There is ample of evidence that the emission has its origin in synchrotron losses of relativistic electrons that have been accelerated in cluster mergers. In a cosmological simulation, we estimate the radio emission of structure formation shocks as follows: introducing a novel approach to identify strong shock fronts in an smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation, we determine the Mach number as well as the downstream density and temperature in the MareNostrum Universe simulation which has 2 &#215; 1024<SUP>3</SUP> particles in a 500h<SUP>-1</SUP>Mpc box. Then, we estimate the radio emission using the formalism derived in Hoeft &#38; Br&#252;ggen to produce artificial radio maps of massive clusters and to derive a luminosity function of diffuse radio sources. Several of our clusters show radio objects with similar morphology to observed large-scale radio relics, whereas about half of the clusters show only very little radio emission. In agreement with observational findings, the maximum diffuse radio emission of our clusters depends strongly on their X-ray temperature. We find that the so-called accretion shocks cause only very little radio emission. We conclude that a moderate efficiency of shock acceleration, namely xi<SUB>e</SUB> = 0.005, and moderate magnetic fields in the region of the relics, namely 0.07-0.8muG are sufficient to reproduce the number density and luminosity of radio relics. },

	Abstract = {We examine diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of the pre-existing as well as freshly injected populations of non-thermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles at weak cosmological shocks. Assuming simple models for thermal leakage injection and Alfv&#233;nic drift, we derive analytic, time-dependent solutions for the two populations of CRs accelerated in the test-particle regime. We then compare them with the results from kinetic DSA simulations for shock waves that are expected to form in intracluster media and cluster outskirts in the course of large-scale structure formation. We show that the test-particle solutions provide a good approximation for the pressure and spectrum of CRs accelerated at these weak shocks. Since the injection is extremely inefficient at weak shocks, the pre-existing CR population dominates over the injected population. If the pressure due to pre-existing CR protons is about 5% of the gas thermal pressure in the upstream flow, the downstream CR pressure can absorb typically a few to 10% of the shock ram pressure at shocks with a Mach number M &lt;~ 3, yet the re-acceleration of CR electrons can result in a substantial synchrotron emission behind the shock. The enhancement in synchrotron radiation across the shock is estimated to be about a few to several for M ~ 1.5 and 10<SUP>2</SUP>-10<SUP>3</SUP> for M ~ 3, depending on the detail model parameters.

	Abstract = {At the request of the conference attendees, we have compiled a classification of extended radio sources in clusters.	These range from scales of tens of parsecs to over a megaparsec in scale, and include both sources associated with AGN and sources thought to derive from the electron population in the ionized ICM.  We pay special attention to distinguishing between the types of AGN in the cores of cooling flow clusters and between the multiple classes of objects referred to over the years as ``radio relics.''  We suggest new names based on physical arguments for some of these classes of objects where their commonly used names are inappropriate or confusing. },

	Abstract = {Some galaxy clusters show diffuse radio emission in the form of peripheral relics (so far attributed to primary, shock-(re)accelerated electrons) or central halos. Analysing radio and X-ray data from the literature, we find new connections between halos and relics, such as a universal linear relation between their peak radio brightness and the gas column density. Our results indicate that halos, relics, and halo-relic bridges in a cluster, all arise from the same, homogeneous cosmic ray (CR) ion (CRI) distribution. We analytically derive the signature of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons (CREs) produced in hadronic CRI collisions, for an arbitrary magnetic field evolution. In our model, flat spectrum halos (both giant and minihalos) arise from steady-state magnetic fields, whereas relics and steep halos reflect recent or irregular magnetic growth. This naturally explains the properties of halos, relics, and the connections between them, without invoking particle (re)acceleration in weak shocks or turbulence. We find CRI energy densities in the range u_p~10^-[12.4,13.3]erg cm^-3, with a spectral index s_p=-2.20+-0.05, and identify a ~0.1 magnetic energy fraction in some halos and behind relics, as far as 2Mpc from the cluster's centre. The CRI homogeneity suggests strong CR diffusion, D(100GeV)&gt;~10^32cm^2s^-1. The strong magnetisation imposes strict upper limits on &gt;10GeV CRE (re)acceleration in weak shocks (efficiency &lt;10^-4) and turbulence; indeed, each weak shock slightly lowers the energy fraction of flat CRs. },

	Abstract = {Chandra observations of the merging galaxy cluster A520 reveal a prominent bow shock with M=2.1+0.4-0.3. This is only the second clear example of a substantially supersonic merger shock front in clusters. Comparison of the X-ray image with that of the previously known radio halo reveals a coincidence of the leading edge of the halo with the bow shock, offering an interesting experimental setup for determining the role of shocks in the radio halo generation. The halo in A520 apparently consists of two spatially distinct parts, the main turbulence-driven component and a cap-like forward structure related to the shock, where the latter may provide preenergized electrons for subsequent turbulent reacceleration. The radio edge may be caused by electron acceleration by the shock. If so, the synchrotron spectrum should have a slope of alpha~=1.2 right behind the edge, with quick steepening farther away from the edge. Alternatively, if shocks are inefficient accelerators, the radio edge may be explained by an increase in the magnetic field and density of preexisting relativistic electrons due to gas compression. In the latter model, there should be radio emission in front of the shock with the same spectrum as that behind it, but 10-20 times fainter. If future sensitive radio measurements do not find such preshock emission, then the electrons are indeed accelerated (or reaccelerated) by the shock, and one will be able to determine its acceleration efficiency. We also propose a method to estimate the magnetic field strength behind the shock, based on measuring the dependence of the radio spectral slope upon the distance from the shock. In addition, the radio edge provides a way to constrain the diffusion speed of the relativistic electrons.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the production of cosmic-ray (CR) protons at cosmological shocks by performing, for the first time, numerical simulations of large-scale structure formation that include directly the acceleration, transport, and energy losses of the high-energy particles. CRs are injected at shocks according to the thermal leakage model and, thereafter, accelerated to a power-law distribution as indicated by the test particle limit of the diffusive shock acceleration theory. The evolution of the CR protons accounts for losses owing to adiabatic expansion/compression, Coulomb collisions, and inelastic p-p scattering. Our results suggest that CR protons produced at shocks formed in association with the process of large-scale structure formation could amount to a substantial fraction of the total pressure in the intracluster medium. Their presence should be easily revealed by GLAST (Gamma-Ray Large-Area Space Telescope) through detection of gamma-ray flux from the decay of pi<SUP>0</SUP> produced in inelastic p-p collisions of such CR protons with nuclei of the intracluster gas. This measurement will allow a direct determination of the CR pressure contribution in the intracluster medium. We also find that the spatial distribution of CR is typically more irregular than that of the thermal gas because it is more influenced by the underlying distribution of shocks. This feature is reflected in the appearance of our gamma-ray synthetic images. Finally, the average CR pressure distribution appears statistically slightly more extended than the thermal pressure. },

	Abstract = {We calculate the flux of non-thermal radiations from the supernova remnant (SNR) RX J1713.7-3946 in the context of the non-linear theory of particle acceleration at shocks, which allows us to take into account self-consistently the dynamical reaction of the accelerated particles, the generation of magnetic fields in the shock proximity and the dynamical reaction of the magnetic field on the plasma. When the fraction of particles which get accelerated is of the order of ~10<SUP>-4</SUP>, we find that the strength of the magnetic field obtained as a result of streaming instability induced by cosmic rays is compatible with the interpretation of the X-ray emitting filaments being produced by strong synchrotron losses in ~100muG magnetic fields. The maximum energy of accelerated protons is &gt;~10<SUP>5</SUP> GeV. If the X-ray filaments are explained in alternative ways, the constraint on the magnetic field downstream of the shock disappears and the HESS data can be marginally fitted with ICS of relativistic electrons off a complex population of photons, tailored to comprise cosmic microwave background and ambient infrared/optical photons. The fit, typically poor at the highest energies, requires a large density of target photons within the remnant; only a fraction of the order of ~10<SUP>-6</SUP> of the background particles gets accelerated; the local magnetic field is of the order of ~20muG and the maximum energy of protons is much lower than the knee energy. Current HESS gamma-ray observations combined with recent X-ray observations by Suzaku do not allow as yet to draw a definitive conclusion on whether RX J1713.7-3946 is an efficient cosmic ray accelerator, although at the present time a hadronic interpretation of HESS data seems more likely. We discuss the implications of our results for the GLAST gamma-ray telescope, which should be able to discriminate the two scenarios discussed above, by observing the shape of the gamma-ray spectrum at lower energies. },

	Abstract = {Upcoming radio telescopes will allow to study the radio sky at low frequencies with unprecedent sensitivity and resolution. New surveys are expected to discover a large number of new radio sources. Here we investigate the abundance of radio relics, i.e. steep-spectrum diffuse radio emission coming from the periphery of galaxy clusters, which are believed to trace shock waves induced by cluster mergers. With the advent of comprehensive relic samples a framework is needed to analyze statistically the relic abundance. To this end, we introduce the probability to find a relic located in a galaxy cluster with given mass and redshift allowing us to relate the halo mass function of the Universe with the radio relic number counts. Up to date about 45 relics have been reported and we compile the resulting counts, N(>S_1.4). In principle, the parameters of the distribution could be determined using a sufficiently large relic sample. However, since the number of known relics is still small for that purpose we use the MareNostrum Universe simulation to determine the relic radio power scaling with cluster mass and redshift. Our model is able to reproduce the recently found tentative evidence for an increase in the fraction of clusters hosting relics, both with X-ray luminosity and redshift, using an X-ray flux limited cluster sample. Moreover, we find that a considerable fraction of faint relics (S_1.4 < ~10 mJy) reside in clusters with an X-ray flux below ~3e-12 erg/s/cm^2. Finally, we estimate the number of radio relics which await discovery by future low frequency surveys proposed for LOFAR and WSRT. We estimate that the WODAN survey proposed for WSRT may discover 900 relics and that the LOFAR-Tier 1-120 MHz survey may discover about 2500 relics. However, the actual number of newly discovered relics will crucially depend on the existence of sufficiently complete galaxy cluster catalogues.},

	Abstract = {Constraints on the diffusion and acceleration parameters in five young supernova remnants (SNRs) are derived from the observed thickness of their X-ray rims, as limited by the synchrotron losses of the highest energy electrons, assuming uniform and isotropic turbulence. From a joint study of the electrons diffusion and advection in the downstream medium of the shock, it is shown that the magnetic field must be amplified up to values between 250 and 500 muG in the case of Cas A, Kepler, and Tycho, or &tilde; 100 muG in the case of SN 1006 and G347.3-0.5. The diffusion coefficient at the highest electron energy can also be derived from the data, by relating the X-ray energy cutoff to the acceleration timescale. Values typically between 1 and 10 times the Bohm diffusion coefficient are found to be required. We also find interesting constraints on the energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient, by requiring that the diffusion coefficient at the maximum proton energy be not smaller than the Bohm value in the amplified field. This favours diffusion regime between the Kraichnan and the Bohm regime, and rejects turbulence spectrum indices larger than ~= 3/2. Finally, the maximum energy of the accelerated particles is found to lay between 10<SUP>13</SUP> and 5&#215; 10<SUP>13</SUP> eV for electrons, and around Z&#215; 8&#215; 10<SUP>14</SUP> eV at most for nuclei (or &tilde; 2.5 times less if a Bohm diffusion regime is assumed), roughly independently of the compression ratio assumed at the shock. Even by taking advantage of the uncertainties on the measured parameters, it appears very difficult for the considered SNRs in their current stage of evolution to produce protons up to the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum, at &tilde; 3&#215; 10<SUP>15</SUP> eV, and essentially impossible to accelerate Fe nuclei up to either the ankle at &tilde; 3&#215; 10<SUP>18</SUP> eV or the second knee at &tilde; 5&#215; 10<SUP>17</SUP> eV. },

	Abstract = {We develop a formalism for the identification and accurate estimation of the strength of structure formation shocks during cosmological smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. Shocks play a decisive role not only for the thermalization of gas in virializing structures but also for the acceleration of relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) through diffusive shock acceleration. Our formalism is applicable both to ordinary non-relativistic thermal gas, and to plasmas composed of CRs and thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytic solution to the one-dimensional Riemann shock tube problem for a composite plasma of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods to study the properties of structure formation shocks in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model. We find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal shocks with Mach numbers which are predominantly central flow shocks or merger shock waves traversing halo centres. Collapsed cosmological structures are surrounded by external shocks with much higher Mach numbers up to , but they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization. This is because of the higher pre-shock gas densities within non-linear structures, and the significant increase of the mean shock speed as the characteristic halo mass grows with cosmic time. We show that after the epoch of cosmic reionization the Mach number distribution is significantly modified by an efficient suppression of strong external shock waves due to the associated increase of the sound speed of the diffuse gas. Invoking a model for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find that the average strength of shock waves responsible for CR energy injection is higher than that for shocks that dominate the thermalization of the gas. This implies that the dynamical importance of shock-injected CRs is comparatively large in the low-density, peripheral halo infalling regions, but is less important for the weaker flow shocks occurring in central high-density regions of haloes. When combined with radiative dissipation and star formation, our formalism can also be used to study CR injection by supernova shocks, or to construct models for shock-induced star formation in the interstellar medium. },

	Abstract = {Complementary views of galaxy clusters in the radio synchrotron, hard X-ray inverse Compton and high-energy gamma-ray regimes are critical in calibrating them as high-precision cosmological probes. We present predictions for scaling relations between cluster mass and these non-thermal observables. To this end, we use high-resolution simulations of a sample of galaxy clusters spanning a mass range of almost two orders of magnitudes, and follow self-consistent cosmic ray physics on top of the radiative hydrodynamics. We model relativistic electrons that are accelerated at cosmological structure formation shocks and those that are produced in hadronic interactions of cosmic rays with ambient gas protons. Calibrating the magnetic fields of our model with Faraday rotation measurements, the synchrotron emission of our relativistic electron populations matches the radio synchrotron luminosities and morphologies of observed giant radio haloes and minihaloes surprisingly well. Using the complete sample of the brightest X-ray clusters observed by ROSAT in combination with our gamma-ray scaling relation, we predict GLAST to detect about ten clusters allowing for Eddington bias due to the scatter in the scaling relation. The expected brightest gamma-ray clusters are Ophiuchus, Fornax, Coma, A3627, Perseus and Centaurus. The high-energy gamma-ray emission above 100 MeV is dominated by pion decays resulting from hadronic cosmic ray interactions. We provide an absolute lower flux limit for the gamma-ray emission of Coma in the hadronic model which can be made tighter for magnetic field values derived from rotation measurements to match the GLAST sensitivity, providing thus a unique test for the possible hadronic origin of radio haloes. Our predicted hard X-ray emission, due to inverse Compton emission of shock accelerated and hadronically produced relativistic electrons, falls short of the detections in Coma and Perseus by a factor of 50. This casts doubts on inverse Compton interpretation and reinforces the known discrepancy of magnetic field estimates from Faraday rotation measurements and those obtained by combining synchrotron and inverse Compton emission. },

	Abstract = {Entering a new era of high-energy gamma-ray experiments, there is an exciting quest for the first detection of gamma-ray emission from clusters of galaxies. To complement these observational efforts, we use high-resolution simulations of a broad sample of galaxy clusters, and follow self-consistent cosmic ray (CR) physics using an improved spectral description. We study CR proton spectra as well as the different contributions of the pion decay and inverse-Compton emission to the total flux and present spectral index maps. We find a universal spectrum of the CR component in clusters with surprisingly little scatter across our cluster sample. When CR diffusion is neglected, the spatial CR distribution also shows approximate universality; it depends however on the cluster mass. This enables us to derive a semi-analytic model for both the distribution of CRs as well as the pion decay gamma-ray emission and the secondary radio emission that results from hadronic CR interactions with ambient gas protons. In addition, we provide an analytic framework for the inverse-Compton emission that is produced by shock-accelerated CR electrons and is valid in the full gamma-ray energy range. Combining the complete sample of the brightest X-ray clusters observed by ROSAT with our gamma-ray scaling relations, we identify the brightest clusters for the gamma-ray space telescope Fermi and current imaging air Cerenkov telescopes (IACTs) (MAGIC, HESS, VERITAS). We reproduce the previous result of Pfrommer, but provide somewhat more conservative predictions for the fluxes in the energy regimes of Fermi and IACTs when accounting for the bias of `artificial galaxies' in cosmological simulations. We find that it will be challenging to detect cluster gamma-ray emission with Fermi after the second year but this mission has the potential of constraining interesting values of the shock acceleration efficiency after several years of surveying. Comparing the predicted emission from our semi-analytic model to that obtained by means of our scaling relations, we find that the gamma-ray scaling relations underpredict, by up to an order of magnitude, the flux from cool-core clusters. },

	Abstract = {Many shell supernova remnants are now known to radiate synchrotron X-rays. Several objects have also been detected in TeV gamma rays. Nonthermal X-rays and gamma rays can be produced in shell remnants by extremely energetic ions and electrons due to decay of pi<SUP>0</SUP> mesons produced in inelastic collisions between ions and thermal gas, or by electron synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, or inverse-Compton radiation. Thus observations at X-ray and gamma-ray wavelengths constrain the process of particle acceleration to high energies in the shock waves of supernova remnants. This review examines the relevant characteristics of Type Ia and core-collapse supernovae, the dynamics of their evolution through the Sedov blast-wave phase, the basic physics of diffusive shock acceleration, and the physics of the relevant radiative processes. It also reviews the current status of observations of shell remnants from X-rays to TeV gamma rays, and summarizes what we can learn about particle acceleration. },

@article{ryu03,
	Abstract = {We study the properties of cosmological shock waves identified in high-resolution, N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of a LambdaCDM universe and their role on thermalization of gas and acceleration of nonthermal, cosmic-ray (CR) particles. External shocks form around sheets, filaments, and knots of mass distribution when the gas in void regions accretes onto them. Within those nonlinear structures, internal shocks are produced by infall of previously shocked gas to filaments and knots and during subclump mergers, as well as by chaotic flow motions. Due to the low temperature of the accreting gas, the Mach number of external shocks is high, extending up to M~100 or higher. In contrast, internal shocks have mostly low Mach numbers. For all shocks of M&gt;=1.5, the mean distance between shock surfaces over the entire computed volume is ~4 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc at present, or ~1 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc for internal shocks within nonlinear structures. Identified external shocks are more extensive, with their surface area ~2 times larger than that of identified internal shocks at present. However, especially because of higher preshock densities but also due to higher shock speeds, internal shocks dissipate more energy. Hence, the internal shocks are mainly responsible for gas thermalization as well as CR acceleration. In fact, internal shocks with 2&lt;~M&lt;~4 contribute about one-half of the total dissipation. Using a nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration model for CR protons, we estimate the ratio of CR energy to gas thermal energy dissipated at cosmological shock waves to be about one-half through the history of the universe. Our result supports scenarios in which the intracluster medium contains energetically significant populations of CRs. },

	Abstract = {We present new results characterizing cosmological shocks within adaptive mesh refinement N-body/hydrodynamic simulations that are used to predict nonthermal components of large-scale structure. This represents the first study of shocks using adaptive mesh refinement. We propose a modified algorithm for finding shocks from those used on unigrid simulations that reduces the shock frequency of low Mach number shocks by a factor of ~3. We then apply our new technique to a large, (512 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc)<SUP>3</SUP>, cosmological volume and study the shock Mach number (M) distribution as a function of preshock temperature, density, and redshift. Because of the large volume of the simulation, we have superb statistics that result from having thousands of galaxy clusters. We find that the Mach number evolution can be interpreted as a method to visualize large-scale structure formation. Shocks with M&lt;5 typically trace mergers and complex flows, while 5&lt;M&lt;20 and M&gt;20 generally follow accretion onto filaments and galaxy clusters, respectively. By applying results from nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration models using the first-order Fermi process, we calculate the amount of kinetic energy that is converted into cosmic-ray protons. The acceleration of cosmic-ray protons is large enough that in order to use galaxy clusters as cosmological probes, the dynamic response of the gas to the cosmic rays must be included in future numerical simulations. },

	Abstract = {Cosmological shocks are a critical part of large-scale structure formation, and are responsible for heating the intracluster medium in galaxy clusters. In addition, they are capable of accelerating non-thermal electrons and protons. In this work, we focus on the acceleration of electrons at shock fronts, which is thought to be responsible for radio relics---extended radio features in the vicinity of merging galaxy clusters. By combining high-resolution adaptive mesh refinement/N-body cosmological simulations with an accurate shock-finding algorithm and a model for electron acceleration, we calculate the expected synchrotron emission resulting from cosmological structure formation. We produce synthetic radio maps of a large sample of galaxy clusters and present luminosity functions and scaling relationships. With upcoming long-wavelength radio telescopes, we expect to see an abundance of radio emission associated with merger shocks in the intracluster medium. By producing observationally motivated statistics, we provide predictions that can be compared with observations to further improve our understanding of magnetic fields and electron shock acceleration.},

	Abstract = {Galaxy clusters form through a sequence of mergers of smaller galaxy clusters and groups. Models of diffusive shock acceleration suggest that in shocks that occur during cluster mergers, particles are accelerated to relativistic energies, similar to conditions within supernova remnants. In the presence of magnetic fields, these particles emit synchrotron radiation and may form so-called radio relics. We detected a radio relic that displays highly aligned magnetic fields, a strong spectral index gradient, and a narrow relic width, giving a measure of the magnetic field in an unexplored site of the universe. Our observations show that diffusive shock acceleration also operates on scales much larger than in supernova remnants and that shocks in galaxy clusters are capable of producing extremely energetic cosmic rays. },
