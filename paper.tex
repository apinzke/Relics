\section{Introduction}
Diffuse radio emission in clusters falls into two broad classes: smooth, centrally located and unpolarized radio halos (\citet{ferrari08}, and references therein), and elongated, significantly polarized and steep spectrum radio relicsâ which are seen at cluster outskirts (\citet{kempner04}, and references therein). Both are associated with merging clusters. Radio relics are thought to come in distinct classes: fossil AGN radio lobes, which may have been re-energized by compression (â€˜radio phoenixâ€™; \citet{enslin01}), and those produced by direct Fermi-I particle acceleration at accretion/merger shocks (radio gischt; \citet{ensslin98,miniati01}). Many radio relics have now been seen ($\sim 45$; for a recent compilation, see \citet{nuza11}); the number could increase dramatically with upcoming low freqency radio surveys proposed for the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT), and farther in the future, Square Kilometer Array (SKA). Using numerical simulations combined with an semi-analytic model for radio emission calibrated to existing number counts, \citet{nuza11} estimate that LOFAR and WSRT could discover $\sim 2500$ relics and $\sim 900$ relics respectively. The time is therefore ripe to understand how we can best mine these future surveys.   

In this paper, we focus on radio gischt, which trace structure formation shock waves. They therefore can illuminate the nature of cosmic accretion/mergers, as well as shock amplification of large-scale  magnetic fields \citep{pfrommer08, hoeft08, battaglia09, skillman11}. Perhaps even more importantly, they allow us to probe in detail the efficiency of shock acceleration in a diffuse, low Mach number (${\cal M} \sim 2-4$) regime far different from the high Mach number regimes probed in our Galaxy and supernova remnants. Whilst this remains poorly understood, observations seem to suggest an electron acceleration efficiency significantly in excess of naive theoretical expectiations. In this paper, we explore a promising explanation: the existence of a seed population of low energy ($\gamma \sim 200$) relic relativistic electrons from high redshift which are reaccelerated by low-redshift shocks.  

A recent spectacular example of radio gischt is CIZA J2242.8+5301, the 'sausage relic'  \citep{van-weeren10}, a large ($\sim 2$ Mpc long; located $\sim 1.5$ Mpc from the cluster center) double radio relic system. The post-shock radio spectral index was used to infer the particle spectral slope and hence the shock compression ratio and Mach number (${\cal M} \sim 4.6$), while the decrease in the spectral index (from $\sim 0.6$ to $\sim 2.0$ across the relicâ narrow $\sim 55$ kpc width) toward the cluster center---spectral aging due to synchrotron and inverse Compton losses---was used to infer magnetic field strengths of $\sim 5 \, \mu$G. The strong ($\sim 50-60 \%$) polarization can be attributed to magnetic field frozen into the compressed ICM, which has been aligned parallel to the shock. The properties of this and similar systems are distinct from fossil radio plasma, which are smaller, have curved, steeper spectra (due to aging), and lobe-like morphology. The power-law spectral index, spectral gradient, and enormous extent clearly support a diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) origin. 

However, this then presents a puzzle. Cosmological simulations show that while gas initially undergoes strong shocks (up to ${\cal M} \sim 10^{3}$) accreting onto non-linear structures and filaments, shocks in the ICM and cluster outskirts are relatively modest (${\cal M} \sim 1-5$), since the gas has already reached sub-keV temperatures \citep{ryu03,pfrommer06,skillman08}. While DSA is efficient in accelerating particles in the thermal Maxwellian tail at high Mach numbers \citep{bell78,drury83}, and as confirmed in observations of supernova remnants \citep{parizot06,reynolds08}, at lower Mach numbers the efficiency of DSA is known to plummet exponentially {\bf SPO: should we include a figure of this? To me this paper is motivated by 2 figures, that of the acceleration efficiency as a function of Mach number and the cooling time as a function of energy---we could put it in 1 figure.} Indeed, in the test-particle regime where suprathermal particles undergo acceleration via a thermal leakage process (which compare well against kinetic DSA simulations) the acceleration efficiency for weak shocks ${\cal M} \sim 3$ is extremely small; the fraction of protons accelerated is $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, and cosmic ray proton pressure is $\lsim 1\%$ of the shock ram pressure \citep{kang11}. The acceleration efficiency of electrons at low Mach numbers is likely to be far smaller still. The injection problem for thermal electrons already known to be severe at high Mach numbers, due to the smaller gyroradius of thermal electrons: the relative acceleration efficiency of cosmic ray electrons is lower by $\sim 10^{-2}$ as in the Galaxy \citep{schlickeiser02} or even $\sim 10^{-4}$ as in supernova remnants \citep{morlino09}). These relative efficiencies likely plummets further at low Mach numbers. These considerations appear to contradict the appearance of bright radio relics, and perhaps suggest that our understanding of DSA at low Mach numbers is incomplete (for recent progress, see \citep{gargate12}). 

A possible solution is if there is a pre-existing population of cosmic ray electrons with gyroradii comparable or larger than that of the shock thickness. In this case, injection from the thermal pool is no longer an issue \citep{markevitch05,giacintucci08,kang11}; here,  \citet{kang11} show that re-acceleration should dominate over fresh injection. %\footnote{Turbulent re-acceleration, which is thought to operate at lower Mach numbers, also requires a seed population of relativistic particles}. 
DSA has a much larger effect on radio emission than adiabatic compression; including the downstream magnetic field amplification, synchrotron emission could be boosted by a factor $\sim 100-1000$ for ${\cal M}\sim 3$ \citep{kang11}. Thus, the luminosity function of radio gischt will be strongly modified by the presence or absence of a seed relativistic electron population, whose existence has never been directly demonstrated. In this paper, we use our existing high-resolution SPH simulations of cosmic-ray protons in clusters \citep{pinzke10} to infer whether structure formation shocks could generate them\footnote{They could also have a non-gravitational origin, such as AGN injection, though the filling factor at these large radii is likely to be small.}, taking into account the effects of electron cooling. Note that DSA operates identically on relativistic particles of the same rigidity ($R=pc/Ze$), so the injected proton and electron spectrum are the same, modulo their relative acceleration efficiency, which we conservatively calibrate off Galactic observations.%\footnote{Note, however, that at energies where protons are subrelativistic, the electron spectrum has to be obtained from the proton spectrum by extrapolating the latter from the relativistic regime.} 
In the low-density outskirts of clusters, proton loss timescales are several Hubble times, so we can directly derive the injected energy to each SPH CRp particle directly from our existing simulation snapshots and derive an appropriate scaled injection of CR electrons (CRe). Unlike CRp, Coulomb and inverse Compton/synchrotron loss processes are more efficient and have to be taken into account (IC off the CMB, which has an equivalent energy density of $B=3.24 (1+z)^{2} \mu$G, should dominate in the outer regions). We evolve the time-dependent cosmic-ray energy equation to track the evolving distribution function of CRe. In Fig \ref{fig:ensslin}, we can see that the $\sim 10$ GeV CRe  responsible for $\sim$GHz emission in a $\mu$G field has energy loss timescales of $\sim 10^{8}$yr, but a large population of $\sim 100$ MeV electrons could build up. Note that secondary CRe which arise from hadronic interactions of CRp are not thought to be significant at these low densities, though for a dissenting view, see \citet{keshet10}. We calculate the abundance of such seed electrons from structure formation shocks in the cluster outskirts. In general, we find that they are, reaffirming radio gischt as a reliable tracer of large scale shocks and magnetic fields

\label{sect:estimates}


\section{Simulations}
\label{sect:simulations}
Our simulations were performed in a $\Lambda$CDM universe using the
cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\mr m}=\Omega_\DM + \Omega_{\mr
  b}=0.3, \, \Omega_{\mr b}=0.039, \, \Omega_\Lambda=0.7, \, h=0.7, \,
n_{\mr s}=1$, and $\sigma_8=0.9$. The total matter density in units of
the critical density of the universe $\rho_{\rm crit}$ is denoted by
$\Omega_{\mr m}$, the baryonic density by $\Omega_{\mr b}$, the DM
density by $\Omega_\DM$ and the cosmological constant today is denoted
by $\Omega_\Lambda$. The critical density, $\rho_{\rm crit}=3H_0/(8\pi
G)$, where the present day Hubble constant $H_0=100\, h \, \mr{km}\,
\mr{s}^{-1} \, \mr{Myr}^{-1}$. $n_{\mr s}$ represents the spectral
index of the primordial power-spectrum, and $\sigma_8$ denotes the
$rms$ linear mass fluctuation within a sphere of radius $8 \,h^{-1}
\mr{Mpc}$ extrapolated to $z = 0$. The simulations were carried out
with an updated and extended version of the distributed-memory
parallel TreeSPH code GADGET-2 \citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S,
  2001NewA....6...79S}. Gravitational forces were computed using a
combination of particle-mesh and tree algorithms.  Hydrodynamic forces
are computed with a variant of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(SPH) algorithm that conserves energy and entropy where appropriate,
i.e. outside of shocked regions \citep{2002MNRAS.333..649S}.  Our
simulations follow the radiative cooling of the gas, star formation,
supernova feedback, and a photo-ionizing background \citep[details can
  be found in][]{2007MNRAS.378..385P}. We model the cosmic ray (CR)
physics in a self-consistent way \citep{pfrommer06,
  2007A&A...473...41E, 2008A&A...481...33J} and attach a CR proton
distribution function to each SPH fluid element. We include the
adiabatic CR transport process such as compression and rarefaction,
and a number of physical source and sink terms which modify the cosmic
ray pressure of each CR population separately. The most important
sources considered for injection are, diffusive shock acceleration at
cosmological structure formation shocks and shock waves in supernova
remnants, while the primary sinks are thermalization by Coulomb
interactions, and catastrophic losses by hadronization. For
simplicity, in this paper we do not take into account CRs injected
into the inter-stellar medium from supernova remnants (see Pinzke, Oh,
and Pfrommer, in prep. for a discussion of this topic).

\section{Method}
\label{sect:method}
In this section we explain both the method that we use to derive the
CR electron distribution function that builds up during the structure
formation process of galaxy clusters, and the formalism for
calculating synchrotron emission from in galaxy cluster that is
undergoing a merger at low redshifts.

Our scheme is summarized in decending order by the following bullet points:
\begin{itemize}
\item derive CR proton distribution function from each simulation output at different time $t$
\item calculate injected CR proton population between snapshots 
\item convert injected protons to injected electrons
\item evolve each injected CR electron population to a later time $\tend$ by
  accounting for losses (Coulomb, inverse Compton, and adiabatic)
\item add up the CR electron distribution for all SPH particles at time $\tend$
\item re-accelerate CR electron distribution function at time $\tend$
  using typical values for a merging shock in cluster outskirts
\item calculate the synchrotron radio emission from radio relic
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CR protons}
The CR protons in the simulations are represented by a one-dimensional
isotropic distribution function \footnote{The three dimensional
  distribution function is given by $4\pi \int f(\gam)\, \gam^2\, \dd \gam$.}
given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:f_p}
  f_\p(\gap) = \frac{\dd^2 N_\p}{\dd \gap\,\dd V} = 
  C\, \gap^{-\alpha}\,\theta(\gap-q)\,, 
\end{equation}
and $\gap \approx P_\p/m_\p c$, where we have normalized the proton momentum
$P_\p$ with the proton mass $m_\p$. Here $q$ is the mass normalized
momentum cutoff, $\alpha$ the spectral index, and $C$ the
normalization of the distribution function in units of density. 

To improve the numerical efficiency of the simulations the CR proton
distribution function is parametrized in terms of adiabatic invariant
momentum cutoff $q_0$ and the adiabatic invariant Lagrangian amplitude
of the spectrum $\tilde{C}_0$. We convert the adiabatic invariant
quantities to physical quantities through
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:q0}
  q=\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}q_0\,,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:C0}
  \tilde{C}=\left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^{-\frac{\alpha-1}{3}}\tilde{C}_0\,,
\end{equation}
where the convenient unitless redefinition of the CR proton amplitude
is given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:Ct}
  \tilde{C}=C\,m_\p/\rho\,.
\end{equation}

\del{We select particles in the outskirts of clusters where the gas
  densities are low and hence the Coulomb cooling of the CR protons
  small.}

The CR electron distribution function can not be derived directly
from the CR protons because of the different timescales of
losses. Instead we first need to derive the injected CR proton
distribution function between each snapshot.  The injected distribution
function is calculated as the change in CR normalization between a
snapshot at time $t$ and an earlier time $t-\Delta t$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:finj}
f_\rmn{inj,p}(t,\gap) &=& \Delta C(t)\,\frac{\rho}{m_\p}\,\rmn{X(\rho)} \,
\gap^{-\alpha}\qquad\rmn{where}\\
  \Delta  C(t) &=& C(t) - C(t-\Delta t)\,
\end{eqnarray}
and the adiabatic cooling term
$\rmn{X}(\rho)\equiv\left(\rho/\rho_0\right)^{-1/3}$. The time between
snapshots is denoted by $\Delta t$ and is shown in
Table~\ref{tab:cluster_sample} for each simulated cluster. Note that
for most clusters we can not resolve the cooling timescale of CR
electrons, and hence we over predict the abundance of electrons for
low and high momenta (see Figure~\ref{fig:e_spec_tests} for more
details) for some clusters. Although, in the region between $\gamma ~
(10-10^3)$ is small enough to resolve the cooling processes.


\subsection{CR electrons}
The main difference between the CR electrons and CR protons comes from
the less efficent acceleration of the electrons due to the smaller
gyroradius, and typically the larger losses. We derive the CR electron
distribution function by renormalizing the injected CR proton spectrum to
account for the different acceleration efficiencies as well as the
shift in momentum due to the factor $\sim 2000$ difference in mass. In
addition we model the Coulomb and radiative losses of the CR
electrons.

The injected CR electron distribution function at each time $t$ is
given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:f_inj_e}
  f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gae,t) &\equiv&  
\frac{\dd^2 N_\rmn{inj,e}}{\dd V \dd \gap}(\gae,t) = 
\frac{\dd^2 N_\rmn{inj,e}}{\dd V \dd \gae}(\gae,t)\,Y \nonumber\\
&=& \frac{\dd^2 N_\rmn{inj,p}}{\dd V \dd \gap}(\gap,t)
\left(\frac{\gae}{\gap}\right)^{-\alpha}\frac{\eta_\rmn{max,e}}{\eta_\rmn{max,p}}Y = 
\Delta C(t)\,\gae^{-\alpha}\frac{\eta_\rmn{max,e}}{\eta_\rmn{max,p}}Y\,.
 \nonumber\\
&& \\
\rmn{where}&& Y=\frac{m_\p}{m_\e}
\end{eqnarray}
We use that maximal 50\% of the energy available in a shock is
injected into CR protons ($\eta_\rmn{max,p}$) and a factor 10 smaller
efficiency of 5\% for the CR electrons ($\eta_\rmn{max,e}$). Note that
for readability we now drop the electron index $\e$ on the lorentz
factor $\gae$ for the electrons. 

The CR electrons cool through inverse Compton (IC) emission and
Coulomb losses on timescales that are relative short compared to the
dynamical timescale of a cluster. We model these looses analytically
by instantaneously injecting a power-law of electrons at time $t_i$
and evolving it to a later time $t_f$ (for further details see
\citep{1999ApJ...520..529S}). The loss of energy for each particle is
described by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:d_cool}
\frac{\dd \gam}{\dd t} = - b(\gam,t)\,,
\end{equation}
where the loss function $b(\gam,t)$ is dominated by Coulomb and IC
losses for the energies and gas densities relevant in this work. The
Coulomb losses are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:b_C}
  b_\rmn{C}(\gam) &=& b_\rmn{C} \gam^2 
  = \frac{3\,\sigma_\rmn{T}\,n_\rmn{el}\,c}{2}
  \left[\ln\left(\frac{m_\e c^2 \sqrt{\gam-1}}{\hbar\,\omega_\rmn{plasma}}\right)\right.\nonumber \\
    &-&\ln(2)\left(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\gam}\right)+\frac{1}{2}+
    \left.\left(\frac{\gam-1}{4\gam}\right)^2\right]\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\omega_\rmn{plasma} = \sqrt{4\pi e^2 n_\e / m_\e}$ is the plasma
frequency, and $n_\e$ is the number density of free electrons. Since
the Coulomb losses for relativistic electrons is almost independent of
energy (logarithmic), we approximate that $b_\rmn{C}(\gam,t)\approx
b_\rmn{C}(t)$ \footnote{We use a constant energy $\gamma=10^2$ to
  model the very weak dependence of energy, and note that the
  particular value of $\gamma$ does not matter as long as
  $\gamma\gg1$.}. We can now derive the shift in energy $\gam_i$ at
time $t_i$ to energy $\gam_f$ at time $t_f$ due to Coulomb cooling by
integrating Eqn.~(\ref{eq:d_cool}):
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:gamma_low}
  \gam_\low \equiv\int_{t_i}^{t_f}\dd t \, b_\rmn{C}(t) = 
  -\int_{\gam_i}^{\gam_f}\dd \gam' = -(\gam_f-\gam_i)\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Beacuse the snapshots are descrete in time, we approximate the low
momentum cut-off between time $t_i$ and the later time $t_f$ by
\begin{eqnarray}
  \label{eq:gamma_low_sum}
  \gam_\low \approx \sum_{j=i}^{f} \gam_\low(\Delta t_j) \approx
  \sum_{j=i}^{f} \Delta t_j \left[b_\rmn{C}(t_{j-1}) + b_\rmn{C}(t_j)\right]/2\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where $j$ denotes the summation over all snapshots between time $t_i$
and the later time $t_f$. Here we have approximated the low momentum
cut-off between two snapshots by the mean given by $\gam_\low(\Delta
t_j) = \Delta t_j \left[b_\rmn{C}(t_{j-1})+ b_\rmn{C}(t_j)\right]/2$,
where $\Delta t_j = t_j - t_{j-1}$. 

We now continue with the IC losses that are given by
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:b_IC}
  b_\IC(\gam,z) = b_\IC \gam^2 (1+z)^4
  = \frac{4}{3}\frac{\sigma_\rmn{T}}{m_\e c} U_\rmn{cmb} \gam^2\,.
\end{equation}
Here $\sigma_\rmn{T}= 8\pi e^4/3(m_\e c^2)^2$ is the Thomson cross
section and $U_\rmn{cmb}$ is the energy density of the CMB at redshift
$z=0$. Similarly to the Coulomb cooling we derive the evolution of energy 
of a particle subject to IC losses through
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:b_IC_evolu}
\frac{\dd \gam}{\gam^2} = -b_\IC (1+z)^4\dd t\,.
\end{equation}
After a time $(t_f-t_i)$ has elapsed, all the electrons with
energies above $\gam_\ma$ have thermalized, where we derive $\gam_\ma$
through integrating Eqn.~(\ref{eq:b_IC_evolu}) from injected time
$z_i=z(t_i)$ to a later time $z_f=z(t_f)$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:b_max}
   \frac{1}{\gam_\ma} \equiv \frac{1}{\gam_f} - \frac{1}{\gam_i} = 
   \frac{b_\IC}{H_0}\left[\Lambda(z_f)-\Lambda(z_i)\right]\,.
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda(z) \approx z + 1.23\,z^2 + 0.50\,z^3 - 0.14\,z^4 -
0.04\,z^5$ in a Lambda CDM universe and
$H_0=100\,h\,\rmn{km}\,\rmn{s}^{-1}\,\rmn{Mpc}^{-1}$ is the Hubble constant.

Given an initial energy $\gam_i$ of an electron at time $t_i$,
Eqn.~(\ref{eq:d_cool}) can be integrated to give the value of $\gam_f$
at a later time $t_f$. The differential population density for
relativistic electrons is then given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:f_evolv}
f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gam_f,t_f,t_i) &=& f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gam_i,t_i)
\left.\frac{\partial\gam_i}{\partial\gam_f}\right|_{t_f}\,,\quad \rmn{where} \\
 f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gam_i,t_i) &=& 
f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gam_f-\Delta\gam_\IC-\Delta\gam_\rmn{C},t_i) \nonumber\\
&=& f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gam_f+\frac{\gam_f^2}{\gam_\ma-\gam_f}+\gam_\low,t_i)\,,\quad \rmn{and} \\
\frac{\partial\gam_i}{\partial\gam_f} &=& 
\frac{\gam_\ma^2}{\left(\gam_\ma-\gam_f\right)^2}\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here we have used that $\Delta\gam_\IC=-\gam_\low$ and
$\Delta\gam_\rmn{C}=\frac{-\gam_f^2}{\gam_\ma-\gam_f}$. The total electron
spectrum is derived from the sum of all individually cooled injected
spectra, starting from the time of injection $t_i$ until a later time
$t_f$,
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:f_sum}
f_\rmn{tot,e}(\gam_f,t_f) = 
\left(\frac{\tilde{\rho}(t_f)}{\rho_0}\right)^{-1/3}\sum_j f_\rmn{inj,e}(\gam_f,t_f,t_j)\,.
\end{eqnarray}
Here the comoving gas density factor $\tilde{\rho}=\rho\,(z+1)^3$ takes care of the
adiabatic gains and losses, where $\rho_0=1$ is a reference comoving density in
GADGET. \del{Also note that the electrons injected at time $t=t_i$ have not
had the time to cool yet.}

We model the final CR electron spectrum as a superposition of five CR
populations, each determined by Eqn.~\ref{eq:f_sum}, but with a
different spectral index and injected spectra. 

\subsection{re-acceleration}

The process of merging clusters is often very violent where large
amounts of gravitational energy being dissipated in the form of
radiation, increased temperature, turbulence flows and shocks. The two
latter processes are believed to accelerate CRs to high energy, where
especially the distribution function of preexisting CRs is
enhanced. We use the CR electron distribution described in previous
section, boost it using the details of the shock, and then finally
calculate the radio synchrotron emission.

NEED TO REWRITE The typical size of a large relic is of the order of a
Mpc, while the thickness is only of the order 100~kpc. We assume that
the rather unknown extension of the relic along the line of sight to
be about 500~kpc, where the total radio emitting volume is about
$0.05~\rmn{Mpc}^3$. 

Note that we neglect the contribution from the thermal electrons that
are accelerated in the same shock. The reason for this is that for
shocks with a Mach number $\lesssim 3$ since CRs that was shown in
\cite{kang11} to .

We follow the prescription outlined in \cite{kang11} to calculate the
steady-state test-particle solution of the downstream CR distribution
that can be written as a function of the pre-existing CRs through
\begin{equation}
  f_\rmn{re-acc,e}(\gae) = q \gae^{-q}\int_{\gam_\rmn{inj}}^\gam \gam'^{q-1}
   f_\rmn{tot,e}(\gam')\dd \gam'\,.
\end{equation}
The lowest momentum boundary above which particles can cross the shock
is given by
\begin{equation}
\gam_\rmn{inj} \approx 1.17 \frac{u_2}{c}\left(1+\frac{1.07}{\epsilon_B}\right)
\left(\frac{M}{3}\right)^{0.1}\,.
\end{equation}

Spectral index
\begin{equation}
q(M) = \frac{3\left(u_1-v_ A\right)}{u_1-v_A-u_2} = 
\frac{3\sigma\left(1-M_A^{-1}\right)}{\sigma-1-\sigma M_A^{-1}}
\end{equation}
where $u_1$ and $u_2$ are the speed of the flow upstream and
downstream, respectively, in the shock rest frame. The compression
ratio is given by $\sigma=u_1/u_2=\rho_2/\rho_1$, and $M_A=u_1/v_A$ is
the upstream AlfvÃ©n Mach number with velocity
$v_A=B_1/\sqrt{4\pi\rho_1}$. We derive the test-particle power-law
slope $q$ as a function of the shock Mach number $M$ with
$\sigma=[(\gam_\rmn{ad}+1)M^2]/[(\gam_\rmn{ad}-1)M^2+2]$, where
adiabatic index $\gam_\rmn{ad}=5/3$, $M_A=M c_s/v_A$, and $ c_s$ the
upstream sound speed.


\subsection{radio synchrotron emission}
In addition we assume that the average magnetic
field in the cluster outskirts to be of the order
$B\approx0.1\,\mu$G. The total emitted power at 1.4 PHz of the size
typical for a large radio Relic is then given by
$P_0(1.4\,\rmn{PHz})=9\times10^{22}$~W/Hz. This is about a factor
10-100 smaller than what is typically expected from a relic
\cite{2009A&A...508...75V}. However, this luminosity is boosted by the
shock or turbulence induced during a cluster merger. We follow the
prescription outlined in \cite{kang11} to calculate the
boost in radio luminosity due to reacceleration, and find that
$P_2(1.4\,\rmn{PHz})\sim\times10^{25}$~W/Hz in agreement with several
of the relics listed in e.g. \cite{2009A&A...508...75V}.

 We calculate the radio synchrotron emissivity of the CR electrons
 using \cite{1979rpa..book.....R}
\begin{equation}
J(\nu) \approx \left(\frac{e^2\,\nu_c}{c}\right)\,\sum_i C_i
\gam\left(\frac{3 \alpha_i-1}{12}\right)\,\gam\left(\frac{3 \alpha_i+19}{12}\right)\frac{3^\frac{\alpha_i}{2}}{\alpha_i+1}\,\left(\frac{\nu}{\nu_c}\right)^{\frac{1-\alpha}{2}}\,,
\end{equation}
where the cyclotron frequency is given by
$\nu_c=e\,B\,c/(2\pi\mecc)$. We derive the total emitted power from
the source by integrating the emissivity over the target volume. Here,
we assume that the target volume haw an uniform distribution of the
CR electrons, hence the total power per unit frequency is given by
\begin{equation}
  P_0(\nu) = \rmn{Volume} \times J_0(\nu)\,.
\end{equation}
