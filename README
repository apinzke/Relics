1) First follow the various repository setup instructions at github (e.g.,
    set up the appropriate ssh keys, etc.).
It took me about 15 minutes to set up. Not sure if you need to give me your
ID before you continue to 2), you could always try ;-)

2) Get an initial local copy of the repository (i.e., paper source files)

   git clone git@github.com:apinzke/Relics.git

3) Set the remote git access:

   git remote add origin git@github.com:apinzke/Relics.git

4) In the future, decend into the local copy of repository and "pull"
    new versions of the repository files to update them:

    git pull origin master

5) When you are finished editing, "commit" the changes (local) and "push"
    the changes into the repository.  This will only affect files that git
    already knows about (e.g., the temporary LaTex files won't suddenly be
    added to the repository).

    git commit -a -m "<Enter short summary of changes>"
    git push origin master

6) If you have files to add (e.g., new beautiful pictures!) or remove (e.g.,
    a wrongly named figure, though this should never really be used)

    git add<file>
    git push origin master
    or
    git rm<file>
    git push origin master
